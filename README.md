## concept of the project
spams are any unwanted or unnecessary messages we get. They include scams, virus links and advertisements and these are different from the messages we get from friends, family, college , workplace etc. 
- #### why do we need to classify and delete spams?
we need to classify and delete spams because they may sometimes contain  viruses or trojans which may get installed to the system once the mail is opened.
we can implement **classification techniques in machine learning** to classify messages which are spam from those which are not. 
- #### algorithms and techniques implemented in this project
  - **LOGISTIC REGRESSION**
  - **NATURAL LANGUAGE PROCESSING**
## the dataset
the dataset used in this project is [**SMS SPAM COLLECTION DATA SET**](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/SMS+Spam+Collection). it is quiet a popular dataset in the world of machine learning. it contains totally 5574 instances where the first word of every instance tells if the message is spam or ham. The message and the label are seperated by a tab space.
